A single machine can process :7.5 checks minute * 24 HOURS *60 MINUTES = 10800 checks a day


This Project will automatically use OCR to retrieve the details of a customer such as an account number, customer name, branch, etc. from the form to be verified.
The signature on the form will be extracted using Image Processing techniques and will be sent to the CNN model that is trained on genuine and forged signatures of the customers. The entire application is demonstrated using Flask where the user can upload a specific template form and the signature is verified as genuine/forged.

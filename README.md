# Automatic-Hand-Written-Signature-Verification-CNN-Model-using-OCR

Problems while verifying signatures manually

    Increase in human efforts
    Time consuming
    Human Error

Thought of AI?

    A single machine can process :7.5 checks minute * 24 HOURS *60 MINUTES = 10800 checks a day


This project will automatically use OCR to retrieve the details of a customer such as an account number, customer name, branch, etc. from the form to be verified.

The signature on the form will be extracted using Image Processing techniques and will be sent to the CNN model that is trained on genuine and forged signatures of the customers. 

The entire application is demonstrated using Flask where the user can upload a form of a specific template and the signature is verified as genuine/forged.
